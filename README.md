OperSync-notify - a generic IRC notification bot
================================================

## Synopsis
OperSync-Notify is a bot designed to recieve notifications from
[opersync](http://github.com/Elizacat/opersync). It really doesn't do much more than this.

## Examples
Run via: `./main.py`

Edit the config in `config.py`

## Requirements
Requires [PyIRC](http://github.com/Elizacat/PyIRC). It also only uses NickServ auth, so a network
with account-notify is recommended.

## Contributors
This bot has been hacked together by:

* [Elizabeth Myers](http://github.com/Elizacat)
